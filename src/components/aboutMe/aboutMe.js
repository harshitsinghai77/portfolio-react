                            I'm currently a Summer Intern at SourceFuse Technologies. Deep learning warrior with _Python_ as shiny dagger and _Keras_ as blazing shotgun ready to fire. In my spare time, like every other geeky kid, I like to create web apps and develop tiny deep learning models while listening edm in the background thread. Apart from being a data science enthusiast, I like to play football, and watch crime/thriller movies till the late hours.
